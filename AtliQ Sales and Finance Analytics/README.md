# Excel-Based Sales and Financial Analysis for Atliq Hardware

Developed an Excel-based reporting system for Atliq Hardware, leveraging `Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX measures.` Loaded and transformed data from multiple tables, including dim_customer, dim_market, dim_product, fact_sales_monthly, and ns_target_21, using Power Query. Created custom columns and a date table to enhance data analysis capabilities. Utilized Power Pivot's diagram view to establish relationships between the tables.

Implemented key DAX measures, including Net Sales, Net Sales by Year (2019, 2020, 2021), 21 vs 20 comparison, target21, 2021 - Target, and 2021 - Target %. These measures provided insights into sales performance, target achievement, and profitability. Developed various pivot table reports, such as Customer Net Sales Performance, Top 10 Products, Division-level Sales, New Products Launched, and P&L by Fiscal Years (Net Sales, COGS, Gross Margin, etc.).

This project enables a comprehensive analysis of Atliq Hardware's sales and financial data, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions, identify trends, and evaluate the company's performance over different fiscal years.

This is a project I did as part of [CodeBasics Excel](https://codebasics.io/courses/excel-mother-of-business-intelligence) course.
